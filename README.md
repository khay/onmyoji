I've been playing Onmyoji game since it is released on Global on 2018 Janurary. Since then, I'm using [Onmyoji Guide][2] and [Onmyoji Wikia][3] website to search everything I want to know about the game. I want to make this repo usable for everyone as I will be using data from different sources as well.

### Shikigami

We've finished data for the following shikigami so far.
